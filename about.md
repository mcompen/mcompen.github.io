In 2020 I graduated in physics at the Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands. My master thesis was on quantum machine learning, in particular the Quantum Boltzmann Machine. You can read [my thesis](/assets/pdf/Thesis.pdf) if you want to learn everything about it.

After handing in my thesis I got some rest to think about my next step. I decided against pursuing a career in academia. But still I felt a hole in my soul. All those elegant mathematical and physical theories were violently ripped out of my life! I missed playing with them, [implementing them with Julia](https://github.com/mcompen/NeuralQuantumState.jl), and being generally amazed by them.

Why stop what I loved doing all this time? This website is my tentative note drawer for topics relating to machine learning, physics and coding. Writing helps to organize my thoughts, sharing them keeps me sane.
